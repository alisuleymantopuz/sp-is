If the design is already done fat interfaces can be segregated using the Adapter pattern.

Like every principle Interface Segregation Principle is one principle 
which require additional time and effort spent to apply it during the design time and 
increase the complexity of code. But it produce a flexible design. 
If we are going to apply it more than is necessary it will result a code containing 
a lot of interfaces with single methods, so applying should be done based on experience and 
common sense in identifying the areas where extension of code are more likely to happens in the future.
